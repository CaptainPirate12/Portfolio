# IT Student Portfolio — Black & White Template

This is a minimal black-and-white portfolio template for an IT student.

Visual improvements & safety
- Polished layout, subtle effects, and reveal-on-scroll entrance animations (respecting prefers-reduced-motion).
- Defensive JavaScript and conservative Content-Security-Policy.

How to use
1. Personalize index.html with your name, bio, project descriptions, and email.
2. Add resume.pdf to the repository root if you want the Resume button to download a file.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings to publish the site from the main branch.

Local preview
- Quick local server:
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  then open http://localhost:8000

Notes
- If you add external resources (fonts, images, analytics), update the Content-Security-Policy in index.html accordingly.
